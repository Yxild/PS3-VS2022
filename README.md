# PS3-VS2022
PS3L1GHT Visual Studio Integration Tool (VS2022) 

Why Visual Studio 2022?
Because it's updated? I'm soon going to do 2017 and 2019 so dw

How do I import this into VS2022?
First you will need C++ and thats it, No .NET Required!


(YOU WILL NEED THIS IN VS: C++ 2022 Redistributable Update)
